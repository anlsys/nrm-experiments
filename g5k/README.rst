=================

This directory contains material for experiments on the |g5k| infrastructure.

Deployment
----------

As of today, we rely on the minimal Debian Buster (10) image supplied by the
technical team.
Refer to :file:`README.deploy.rst` for details on how to deploy and run the
Jupyter notebooks.

A dedicated environment will eventually be created.

The directory is organized as follow.
